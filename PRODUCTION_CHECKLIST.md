# Production Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🐛 Debug & Development Code Removal
- [x] Removed all `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn` statements
- [x] Removed all `alert()` statements (replaced with silent handling)
- [x] Removed debug sections (raw JSON display in ScanPage)
- [x] Removed old legacy App.js file
- [x] TestUpgradeButton component already has production check (`import.meta.env.PROD`)

### 🔧 Build Optimization
- [x] Added Terser minification for production builds
- [x] Configured code splitting (vendor chunks for React/React-DOM/React-Router, separate Stripe chunk)
- [x] Build tested and working correctly

### 🔒 Security & Configuration
- [x] Environment variables properly configured with `VITE_API_BASE`
- [x] Error handling sanitized (no sensitive info exposed)
- [x] Test endpoints already properly gated behind development checks

### 📦 Production Build
- [x] Build process optimized and working
- [x] Assets properly chunked and compressed
- [x] File sizes: Main bundle ~82.87 kB gzipped, Vendor ~15.54 kB gzipped

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Before Deployment
1. Set the `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable to your production backend URL
2. Ensure your backend is properly configured and deployed
3. Run `npm run build` to generate the production build

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the web directory with:
```
VITE_API_BASE=https://your-production-api.com
```

### Build Command
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy the `dist/` folder
The built files are in the `dist/` directory and can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- Vercel
- Netlify  
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Azure Static Web Apps
- GitHub Pages

## 🔍 Additional Recommendations

### Performance
- Consider implementing service workers for caching
- Add loading states for better UX
- Consider lazy loading for admin components

### Monitoring
- Add error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Add analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

### Security
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Regular dependency updates

### SEO
- Add meta tags for social sharing
- Implement proper Open Graph tags
- Add structured data markup

## 📝 Notes
- All debug code has been removed
- Error handling is production-ready
- Build is optimized for performance
- Environment variables are properly configured
- Ready for production deployment
